# Solar-System-Simulation

Created this fun Planet Simulation using Python with the help of a tutorial video posted by Tim Ruscica on YouTube.
The goal of this simulation is to simulate the orbits of different planets around the sun using real astronomical values! Also, the force of gravity is applied on each of the planets so we get an accurate elliptical orbit.
